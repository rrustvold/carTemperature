Estimate and verify the interior temperature of my car when parked in the sun

A simple heat transfer model is created that accounts for solar radiation and natural convection. A wireless temperature sensor was also created with and ESP8266 to measure the actual temperature. For outdoor temperatures between 83 and 95 F, the mathematical model was accurate to within 3 F.
